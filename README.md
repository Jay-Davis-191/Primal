# Primal

## Description
This project is a martial-arts/fitness-based streaming app that allows users to view specific moves deligated to them based on their current skill level and age group. The current skill level and age group are  automatically tracked by the app and updated to Firebase whenever necessary. 

Primal was created for a local business in Cairns, Australia with the hopes of creating a partnership as a different business. 

## Development and Timeframe
This app is cross-platform, providing support for both Android and iOS. The app was created using React Native and utilises a cloud database via Firebase to store all user and content information. 

When the prototype was shown to the client, the next steps of the project before further app development could be done was to aid them in recording the content and completing legal requirements regarding the partnership. 

The functionality of the app was completed when the coded-prototype was shown to the client. The only further stages of development were focused on improving the design and further error-debugging. 

This project was delayed by the client due to the alarming cost of potential copyright fees regarding the names of the moves. 

The timeframe for this project was 8 months with planning, discussing, prototyping (via paper and Figma), refining, coding and waiting on external aspects to be confirmed (legal, expenses, investments, etc.)

## How to run
1. Open the app with Visual Studio.
2. Open App.js and select run with Android or iOS emulator.

## Contributions 
This project was solely programmed by me and planned with my silent business partner.
