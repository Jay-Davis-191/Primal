# Primal

## Description
This project is a martial-arts/fitness-based streaming app that allows users to view specific moves deligated to them based on their current skill level and age group. The current skill level and age group are  automatically tracked by the app and updated to Firebase whenever necessary. 

Primal was created for a local business in Cairns, Australia with the hopes of creating a partnership as a different business. 

## Development and Timeframe
This app is cross-platform, providing support for both Android and iOS. The app was created using React Native and utilises a cloud database via Firebase to store all user and content information. 

When the prototype was shown to the client, the next steps of the project before further app development could be done was to aid them in recording the content and completing legal requirements regarding the partnership. 

When the project resumes, I will be implementing the following updates: 
1. Add functionality for coloured stripes and progress bar for the Dashboard.
2. Add images and videos for all fitness and moves to Firebase to then show in the app.
3. Add financial details to the Sign Up page.
4. Create automatic tracking and automatic financial payments for Subscriptions.
5. Allow personal notes for each move to be saved in Firebase using a many-to-many entity.
6. Improve design and continue error-debugging.
   
This project was delayed by the client due to the alarming cost of potential copyright fees regarding the names of the moves. 

The timeframe for this project was 8 months with planning, discussing, prototyping (via paper and Figma), refining, coding and waiting on external aspects to be confirmed (legal, expenses, investments, etc.)

## Features
Apart from the streaming content through photos and videos, the app provides additional features to make the app more convenient and desirable to the user. The target audience for this app is families with children below the ages of 12 who wish to engage their child in physical activity as well as improving the confidence of their children. 

The features implemented in the app to draw in that target audience include:
- A drop down menu on the Dashboard that shows all belt colours the user can choose from. The user can only access belt levels they currently have or have obtained in the past for their current age group.
- New and more challenging moves as the user progresses through the belts.
- A progress bar and coloured stripes on the Home page to encourage the user to keep going as well as show how they are progressing.
- A customisable section for each selected move where the user can write down any personal notes they wish to record for the selected move.
- Each video has the option for full-screen viewing. 

## How to run
1. Open the app with Visual Studio.
2. Open App.js and select run with Android or iOS emulator.

## Contributions 
This project was solely programmed by me and planned with my silent business partner.
