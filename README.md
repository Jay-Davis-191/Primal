# Primal

## Description
This app is a martial-arts/fitness streaming app that was intended for a local company in Cairns. This app is cross-platform for both Android and iOS and was created using React Native. This app also utilises a cloud database via Firebase. 

The goal of the app is to allow the user to view their specific moves and fitness based on their current belt level and age group. The user's belt level and age group is automatically tracked and updated by the app with Firebase. 

The current state of the app was the first iteration of a coded-prototype which allowed te user to sign up and log in, and select their belt level which changed the list of moves they could view. 

This project was cancelled from the company due to the cost of future copyright. 

## How to run
1. Open the app with Visual Studio.
2. Open App.js and select run with Android or iOS emulator.
